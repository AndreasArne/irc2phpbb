An python implementation of an irc bot keeping track of latest posts in a phpbb forum.
Basic code from: http://osix.net/modules/article/?id=780 and http://oreilly.com/pub/h/1968
and developed from there.

The rfc for the irc protocol is quite helpful: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/

The bot is (will be) active in irc://irc.bsnet.se/#db-o-webb which is a irc channel for 
teaching HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and Unix. The forum is on http://dbwebb.se.
